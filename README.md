# Codename Inline Dracozu

It's a game like Zelda 2 only you can aim your sword, and depending on the defensive item, will have to aim that too.

The story follows the main character in their quest to right the wrongs of a society ruled by feudalism and exploitation, or revel in it.

# Key features planned

* Sequential 360 degree aiming of sword and defensive item
* Variety of weapon types that are differentiated by:
..* Length
..* Damage
..* Weight
* All weapons are sidegrades of each other (inb4 lol u start with the best weapon)
* Mercenary system that rates you as a client based on the agreed upon usage contract
..* You can be denied access to certain mercs based on your rating
* Stealth system for those who prefer avoiding combat

# Features that seem impossible but would love to add

* Leveling system
